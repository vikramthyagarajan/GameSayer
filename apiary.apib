## User Games Collection [/users/{userId}/games/created]
User Games are the games a user creates from a set of game types. These games are not games in the traditional sense of the term.
These games represent some content. This content is in the form of questions and slides. When a user playes this "game", he is 
essentially choosing to play said content. The manner in which he plays it (grail hunter/quizspin) is irrelevant.
